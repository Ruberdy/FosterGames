<p><strong>Biggest Zombie Sward Ever, Levin City Siege Battle Begins</strong></p>

<p>In Season 4, players first have to face a zombie swarm of unprecedented scale. Countless new Infected will be attacking Levin City! This horrifying shift requires every survivor to unite to defend and retake Levin.</p>

<p><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20211104/736e70c1-f16b-4e2f-ad3d-898b1addaf70.jpg" /></p>

<p>Zombies swarm is one of the key features of the zombie apocalypse genre. Our update this time will be focusing on that as well—besides the swarms you’ll encounter in stages, they’ll show up during map exploration, creating a compelling visual and battling impact. The dev team has optimized the Infected, making them more realistic and affording them more features. For example, the life they had before they turned zombie will have an impact on their behaviors—athletes more agile and lawyers more prudent. These optimizations aim to arouse fear in players just like they first came to the doomsday world—an instinct fear when facing death and corpse.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition, a great number of machinery of war will be introduced for the first time in this update, such as tanks and helicopter gunships, and tactical gears like turrets and rocket launchers. Survivors will be able to operator these weapons to lay suppressive fire on the Infected and take back Levin City!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>New Gameplay “Battle for Survival”, Witness the Epic Battle</strong></p>

<p>The Season 4 comes with a new gameplay called Battle for Survival. Different from the concept “stages” which everyone has been familiar with, in Battle for Survival players will go through a battle that lasts for 14 days! There will be different quests and storyline development each day and as the protagonists of the battle, every choice and action of survivors will make an actual impact on the doomsday survival. These two Battle for Survival will first be faced by survivors in this update:</p>

<p><strong>Mass Crisis:</strong> <span style="color:black;">Black orbs of unknown nature appeared all around the world. Survivors who go to investigate are attacked by new Infected near the orbs. What will they do when teammate turns Infected and how will they counter these unknown orbs?</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="color:black;">Dusk of Levin</span></strong><span style="color:black;">: After the Mass Crisis, a lot of pollen appeared around the world. Survivors follow the source and end up coming to Levin City. Infected grow stronger by exposing to pollen and the sudden eclipse. Survivors need to rescue refugees while fighting pollen Infected, and find out the last clue.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:black;">Prepare for the Season 4, Rich Bonus Waiting for You</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="color:black;">To celebrate the launch of Season 4: The 2nd Outbreak, the operation team has prepared rich bonus for players to better cope with the new unknown threats!
